## Building a Flask Web Application

Flask is a popular Python web framework for building web applications. Here are the basic steps to build a Flask web application:

1. Install Flask: Use pip to install Flask and its dependencies.
2. Set up your application structure: Create a Flask application object and define your routes.
3. Define your database schema: Choose a database and define your tables and relationships.
4. Implement your views: Write Python functions that handle requests and generate responses.
5. Implement your templates: Use Jinja2 templates to render HTML pages.
6. Run your application: Use Flask's built-in development server or deploy your application to a production server.

With Flask, you can build powerful and scalable web applications using Python.
